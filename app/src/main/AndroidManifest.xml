    <!-- 
    Problem: The application requires access to the internet for data synchronization and management of Instagram user information.
    Solution: Declaring the necessary permissions for internet access to facilitate communication with Instagram's API.
    -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <!-- 
    This permission solves the problem of network access required for data retrieval and management operations, ensuring smooth functionality.
    -->

    <!-- 
    Problem: The application needs to store user data and configurations persistently while allowing easy access.
    Solution: Declaring permission to access external storage for saving data locally.
    -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
    <!-- 
    This permission addresses the challenge of local data storage, enabling the app to save user preferences and configurations effectively.

        <!-- 
        Problem: Continuous background operations are necessary for managing automated tasks without user intervention.
        Solution: Registering AutomationService to handle background operations for user management and scheduling tasks.
        -->
